# Klondike Solitaire Rules (1-Card and 3-Card Draw)

These rules describe standard Klondike setup and play, with **1-card** and **3-card** draw options for the stock. Both variants use **unlimited passes** through the stock.

## Objective
Move all 52 cards to the four foundations, building each suit from Ace to King.

## Terminology
- **Tableau:** Seven piles where cards are played and rearranged.
- **Foundations:** Four suit piles built from Ace to King.
- **Stock:** Face-down draw pile.
- **Waste:** Face-up discard pile from the stock.

## Setup
- Use a standard 52-card deck (no jokers).
- **Tableau:** Deal seven piles left to right. The first pile has 1 card face up; the second has 2 cards (top card face up); continue until the seventh pile has 7 cards with only the top card face up.
- **Foundations:** Four empty piles, one per suit.
- **Stock:** Remaining cards are placed face down.
- **Waste:** Empty pile beside the stock.

## Tableau Play
- Build tableau piles **down in rank** while **alternating colors** (e.g., red 6 on black 7).
- You may move a face-up card or a properly ordered sequence as a unit.
- When a face-up card is moved, flip the next card in that pile face up.
- Empty tableau spaces may be filled **only by a King** (or a sequence starting with a King).

## Foundations
- Foundations are built **by suit** from **Ace to King**.
- Aces start each foundation pile.

## Stock and Waste (Draw Variants)

### 1-Card Draw
- Turn **one card at a time** from the stock to the waste.
- Only the **top waste card** is playable.
- If no moves are available, continue drawing one card at a time.
- When the stock is exhausted, **turn the waste pile face down** to form a new stock and continue. **Unlimited passes** through the stock are allowed.

### 3-Card Draw
- Turn **three cards at a time** from the stock to the waste.
- Only the **top waste card** is playable.
- If no moves are available, continue drawing three cards at a time.
- When the stock is exhausted, **turn the waste pile face down** to form a new stock and continue. **Unlimited passes** through the stock are allowed.

## Winning
You win when all cards are moved to the foundations in ascending order by suit.
